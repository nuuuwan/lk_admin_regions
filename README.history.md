# A Brief History of Administrative Regions in Sri Lanka

## Pre-1833: Before Unification

Before British colonial unification, Sri Lanka was divided into three distinct administrative territories: the maritime provinces (controlled by the British since 1796), the Kandyan Kingdom (an independent sovereign state until 1815), and areas under Dutch influence before British takeover. Each had its own administrative structures and territorial divisions.

## 1833: The Colebrooke-Cameron Reforms

Following the recommendations of the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission, five provinces under one administration came into being. This marked the first unified administrative system across the entire island, integrating both the former maritime provinces and the Kandyan territories:

- Western Province (LK-1) – The maritime districts of Colombo, Chilaw and Puttalam, and the Kandyan provinces of Three Korales, Four Korales, Seven Korales and Lower Bulathgama.
- Central Province (LK-2) – The central Kandyan Provinces.
- Southern Province (LK-3) – The maritime districts of Galle, Hambantota, Matara and Tangalle, and the Kandyan provinces of Lower Uva, Saffragam and Wellassa.
- Northern Province (LK-4) – The maritime districts of Jaffna, Mannar and Vanni, and the Kandyan province of Nuwara Kalawiya.
- Eastern Province (LK-5) – The maritime districts of Batticaloa and Trincomalee, and the Kandyan provinces of Bintenna and Tamankaduwa.

## 1845 to 1889: Provincial Expansion

As the island's population grew and administrative needs became more complex, four additional provinces were created by carving out parts of existing provinces. These changes reflected evolving patterns of settlement, economic development, and the need for more localized governance.

- North Western Province (LK-6) – Created in 1845 from northern parts of the Western Province (the districts of Chilaw, Puttalam and Seven Korales).
- North Central Province (LK-7) – Created in 1873 from southern parts of the Northern Province (district of Nuwara Kalawiya) and north western parts of the Eastern Province (district of Tamankaduwa).
- Uva Province (LK-8) – Created in 1886 from parts of the Central Province, Eastern Province (district of Bintenna) and Southern Province (district of Wellassa).
- Sabaragamuwa Province (LK-9) – Created in 1889 from modern day Ratnapura District, which was part of the Southern Province, and Kegalle, which was part of the Western Province.

## 1955: The Administrative Districts Act

The Administrative Districts Act (No. 22 of 1955) took effect on 14 April 1955, formally establishing the district system for the first time in Sri Lankan law. This act created 21 administrative districts, providing a middle tier between provinces and smaller divisions. Districts became the key unit for coordinating government services, elections, and development planning.

The 21 original districts were:

- Colombo (LK-11), Kalutara (LK-13)
- Kandy (LK-21), Matale (LK-22), Nuwara Eliya (LK-23)
- Galle (LK-31), Matara (LK-32), Hambantota (LK-33)
- Jaffna (LK-41), Mannar (LK-43), Vavuniya (LK-44)
- Batticaloa (LK-51),Trincomalee (LK-53)
- Kurunegala (LK-61), Puttalam (LK-62)
- Anuradhapura (LK-71), Polonnaruwa (LK-72)
- Badulla (LK-81)
- Ratnapura (LK-91), Kegalle (LK-92)

## 1978: Decentralization Era

The adoption of the 1978 Constitution brought significant administrative reforms, including the establishment of district development councils. Two new districts were created to better serve rapidly growing populations:

- Gampaha District (LK-12) – Split from Colombo District to accommodate the rapidly urbanizing areas north of Colombo, reflecting the expansion of the Greater Colombo Metropolitan Region.
- Mullaitivu District (LK-44) – Formed from parts of Jaffna (LK-41), Mannar (LK-42), and Vavuniya (LK-44) to provide better administrative coverage in the northern region.

## 1984: Northern Province Reorganization

- Kilinochchi District (LK-45) – Carved out from Jaffna District (LK-41) to provide more focused administration in the northern interior.

## 1988: Provincial Councils System

The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution (1987) and the Provincial Councils Act (No. 42 of 1987) established the current Provincial Councils system, devolving certain powers to the nine provinces.
