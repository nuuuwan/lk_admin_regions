# A Brief History of Administrative Regions in Sri Lanka

## Pre-1833: Before Unification

Before British colonial unification, Sri Lanka was divided into three distinct administrative territories: the maritime provinces (controlled by the British since 1796), the Kandyan Kingdom (an independent sovereign state until 1815), and areas under Dutch influence before British takeover. Each had its own administrative structures and territorial divisions.

## 1833: The Colebrooke-Cameron Reforms

Following the recommendations of the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission, five provinces under one administration came into being. This marked the first unified administrative system across the entire island, integrating both the former maritime provinces and the Kandyan territories:

- Western Province (LK-1) – The maritime districts of Colombo, Chilaw and Puttalam, and the Kandyan provinces of Three Korales, Four Korales, Seven Korales and Lower Bulathgama.
- Central Province (LK-2) – The central Kandyan Provinces.
- Southern Province (LK-3) – The maritime districts of Galle, Hambantota, Matara and Tangalle, and the Kandyan provinces of Lower Uva, Saffragam and Wellassa.
- Northern Province (LK-4) – The maritime districts of Jaffna, Mannar and Vanni, and the Kandyan province of Nuwara Kalawiya.
- Eastern Province (LK-5) – The maritime districts of Batticaloa and Trincomalee, and the Kandyan provinces of Bintenna and Tamankaduwa.

## 1845 to 1889: Provincial Expansion

Four additional provinces were created by carving out parts of existing provinces:

- North Western Province (LK-6) – Created in 1845 from parts of the Western Province.
- North Central Province (LK-7) – Created in 1873 from parts of the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
- Uva Province (LK-8) – Created in 1886 from parts of the Central, Eastern, and Southern Provinces.
- Sabaragamuwa Province (LK-9) – Created in 1889 from parts of the Southern and Western Provinces.

## 1955: The Administrative Districts Act

The Administrative Districts Act (No. 22 of 1955) took effect on 14 April 1955, creating 20 administrative districts as a middle tier between provinces and smaller divisions.

The 20 original districts were:

- Colombo (LK-11), Kalutara (LK-13)
- Kandy (LK-21), Matale (LK-22), Nuwara Eliya (LK-23)
- Galle (LK-31), Matara (LK-32), Hambantota (LK-33)
- Jaffna (LK-41), Mannar (LK-42), Vavuniya (LK-43)
- Batticaloa (LK-51), Trincomalee (LK-53)
- Kurunegala (LK-61), Puttalam (LK-62)
- Anuradhapura (LK-71), Polonnaruwa (LK-72)
- Badulla (LK-81)
- Ratnapura (LK-91), Kegalle (LK-92)

## 1959 to 1984: Five New Districts

Between 1959 and 1984, five new districts were created:

- Monaragala (LK-82) – 1959, from Badulla District.
- Ampara (LK-52) – 1961, from Batticaloa District.
- Gampaha (LK-12) – 1978, from Colombo District.
- Mullaitivu (LK-44) – 1978, from parts of Jaffna, Mannar, and Vavuniya districts.
- Kilinochchi (LK-45) – 1984, from Jaffna District.

No new districts have been created since 1984, bringing the total to 25 districts.

## 1987: Provincial Councils System

The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, adopted in November 1987, established Provincial Councils as sub-national legislatures. The Provincial Councils Act No. 42 of 1987 set up councils to be elected for five-year terms.

Seven Provincial Councils commenced functioning in early 1988. The Northern and Eastern Provinces were temporarily merged to form one province, but the Supreme Court ruled in 2006 that they should be de-merged as the merger was unconstitutional. The merged Provincial Council functioned for only one year (1988) before being dissolved.

This created the current administrative structure of 9 provinces and 25 districts.

## Grama Niladhari Divisions: Grassroots Administration

Grama Niladhari Divisions (GNDs) represent the lowest administrative unit. Prior to 1963, these areas were under Village Headmen, with the designation changing to Grama Sevaka, then Grama Seva Niladhari, and finally Grama Niladhari.

The number of GNDs expanded from 4,451 in 1987 to 14,016 at present, primarily through the absorption of Special Service Officers (1987), cultivation officers (1988), and agriculture extension officers (1989). The 2001 census identified 35,697 villages served by these divisions.
