# A Brief History of Administrative Regions in Sri Lanka

## Pre-1833: Before Unification

Before British colonial unification, Sri Lanka was divided into three distinct administrative territories: the maritime provinces (controlled by the British since 1796), the Kandyan Kingdom (an independent sovereign state until 1815), and areas under Dutch influence before British takeover. Each had its own administrative structures and territorial divisions.

## 1833: The Colebrooke-Cameron Reforms

Following the recommendations of the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission, five provinces under one administration came into being. This marked the first unified administrative system across the entire island, integrating both the former maritime provinces and the Kandyan territories:

- Western Province (LK-1) – The maritime districts of Colombo, Chilaw and Puttalam, and the Kandyan provinces of Three Korales, Four Korales, Seven Korales and Lower Bulathgama.
- Central Province (LK-2) – The central Kandyan Provinces.
- Southern Province (LK-3) – The maritime districts of Galle, Hambantota, Matara and Tangalle, and the Kandyan provinces of Lower Uva, Saffragam and Wellassa.
- Northern Province (LK-4) – The maritime districts of Jaffna, Mannar and Vanni, and the Kandyan province of Nuwara Kalawiya.
- Eastern Province (LK-5) – The maritime districts of Batticaloa and Trincomalee, and the Kandyan provinces of Bintenna and Tamankaduwa.

## 1845 to 1889: Provincial Expansion

As the island's population grew and administrative needs became more complex, four additional provinces were created by carving out parts of existing provinces. These changes reflected evolving patterns of settlement, economic development, and the need for more localized governance.

- North Western Province (LK-6) – Created in 1845 from northern parts of the Western Province (the districts of Chilaw, Puttalam and Seven Korales).
- North Central Province (LK-7) – Created in 1873 from southern parts of the Northern Province (district of Nuwara Kalawiya) and north western parts of the Eastern Province (district of Tamankaduwa).
- Uva Province (LK-8) – Created in 1886 from parts of the Central Province, Eastern Province (district of Bintenna) and Southern Province (district of Wellassa).
- Sabaragamuwa Province (LK-9) – Created in 1889 from modern day Ratnapura District, which was part of the Southern Province, and Kegalle, which was part of the Western Province.

## 1955: The Administrative Districts Act

The Administrative Districts Act (No. 22 of 1955) took effect on 14 April 1955, formally establishing the district system for the first time in Sri Lankan law. This act created 20 administrative districts, providing a middle tier between provinces and smaller divisions. Districts became the key unit for coordinating government services, elections, and development planning.

The 20 original districts were:

- Colombo (LK-11), Kalutara (LK-13)
- Kandy (LK-21), Matale (LK-22), Nuwara Eliya (LK-23)
- Galle (LK-31), Matara (LK-32), Hambantota (LK-33)
- Jaffna (LK-41), Mannar (LK-43), Vavuniya (LK-44)
- Batticaloa (LK-51), Trincomalee (LK-53)
- Kurunegala (LK-61), Puttalam (LK-62)
- Anuradhapura (LK-71), Polonnaruwa (LK-72)
- Badulla (LK-81)
- Ratnapura (LK-91), Kegalle (LK-92)

## 1959 to 1984: Five New Districts

Between 1959 and 1984, five new administrative districts were carved out by demarcating relevant district boundaries:

- Monaragala District (LK-82) – Created in 1959 from parts of Badulla District to serve the southern areas of Uva Province.
- Ampara District (LK-52) – Established in 1961 from parts of Batticaloa District to provide better administration in the southern Eastern Province.
- Gampaha District (LK-12) – Created in 1978 from Colombo District to accommodate the rapidly urbanizing areas north of Colombo, reflecting the expansion of the Greater Colombo Metropolitan Region.
- Mullaitivu District (LK-45) – Formed in 1978 from parts of Jaffna, Mannar, and Vavuniya districts to provide better administrative coverage in the northern coastal region.
- Kilinochchi District (LK-42) – Established in 1984, carved out from Jaffna District to provide more focused administration in the northern interior.

There has been no increase in the number of districts after 1984. At present, there are 25 administrative districts in Sri Lanka.

## 1987: Provincial Councils System

The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, adopted in November 1987, resulted in the establishment of Provincial Councils as sub-national-level legislatures to attend to a variety of central government functions. The Provincial Councils Act No. 42 of 1987 provided the mechanism to set up the councils to be elected for five-year terms.

The Provincial Councils (Consequential Provisions) Act No. 12 of 1989 empowered the councils to invoke the available laws earlier enforced by government to attend to their legal powers. The power to frame statutes was the mechanism prescribed to adopt Provincial Council laws on the subjects assigned to them.

Seven Provincial Councils commenced functioning from the early part of 1988. The two provinces of the North and the East were temporarily merged to form one province, with the intention to decide on de-merger subsequently. However, the Supreme Court ruled that the two provinces should be de-merged as the original temporary merger was declared unconstitutional (2006).

The Provincial Council elected to office in 1988 for the Northern and Eastern Provinces functioned only for a brief period of one year and was dissolved and brought under the control of Parliament. Elections for the seven Provincial Councils for the North Central, North Western, Western, Central, Uva, Sabaragamuwa, and Southern provinces are conducted under the respective laws.

This created the administrative structure that remains in place today, with 9 provinces and 25 districts.

## Grama Niladhari Divisions: Grassroots Administration

Another important feature in the study of administrative divisions is the establishment of Grama Niladhari Divisions (GNDs) as the lowest unit of administration at the grassroots level. Prior to 1963, these areas were under Village Headmen. The designation of Village Headman was changed to Grama Sevaka, and later to Grama Seva Niladhari. Subsequently, this was again changed to Grama Niladhari.

In 1987, the total number of Grama Seva Niladhari in the island was 4,451. At present, the total number of cadre is 14,016. This increase occurred as a result of the absorption of 2,402 Special Service Officers to the cadre of Grama Seva Niladhari in 1987, 4,532 cultivation officers in 1988, and 3,348 agriculture extension officers in 1989.

According to the village list compiled after the census of 2001, there are 35,697 villages. Grama Niladhari attend to functions of government at the village level, serving as the state's representative at the community level for population records, household enumeration, certificates, and local administration.
